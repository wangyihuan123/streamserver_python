# streamserver_python

## Task:

1. Create a server that streams your webcam stream on a TCP server. The server can also record that stream to a file.
2. Create a UI to control that server functionality which will be start/stop & record to file.

## How to run
1. start server
```
cd src
sudo python3 main.py
```
Then you should see an urgly UI panel.

2. start stream engine from UI by press the "start stream engine" button 

3. start client
```
cd script
python3 client.py
```
Then you should see a window showing the stream video generated by opencv.

## Notes:

1. Work environment:   
- Linux(ubuntu 16.04) or MacOS(10.10)  
- python3.6+  
- opencv  
- tkinter  

2. If you stop the stream engine and want to restart stream again, you probably need to restart client and reconnect to stream server as well. This project is a stream server, so I ignored some features at client side.   

3. The stream can be saved as an AVI video in the directory of `record_data` after press `start recording` button. 

4. Currently the stream server is only designed to service one client. Probably will add multiple clients later after the test environments had been built.

 
## Release
====================================  
**ver 0.0.2**

====================================  
**ver 0.0.1**

Implemented basic functionalities , but has many limitations:
